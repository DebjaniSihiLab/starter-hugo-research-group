We are thrilled to receive funding from Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory [(EMSL)](https://www.emsl.pnnl.gov/news/---projects-awarded-funding-from-emsl/14806). 

Coupling X-ray computed tomography images with ModEx inspired laboratory manipulation experiment for predicting greenhouse gas fluxes from terrestrial–aquatic interfaces

This project will generate fine-scale data to validate a computational tool to advance modeling from fine-scale processes to ecosystem-scale functions to improve understanding of multiscale Earth system dynamics and processes. EMSL capabilities will be used to evaluate how redox heterogeneity across soil microsites influences greenhouse gas emissions from terrestrial–aquatic interfaces.(LINK TO PROJECT PAGE：https://www.emsl.pnnl.gov/news/---projects-awarded-funding-from-emsl/14806).
