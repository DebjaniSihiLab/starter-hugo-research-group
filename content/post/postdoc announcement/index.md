Post-Doctoral Fellow â€“ Soil Carbon Sequestration in Agriculture\
[Here is the link to apply](https://faculty-emory.icims.com/jobs/84869/post-doctoral-fellow--environmental-sciences/job?mobile=false&width=1540&height=500&bga=true&needsRedirect=false&jan1offset=-300&jun1offset=-240)

Description:\
 JOB DESCRIPTION: We invite applications for a postdoctoral researcher on soil carbon in agriculture at the Department of Environmental Sciences, Emory University. The postdoctoral candidate will evaluate soil carbon sequestration potential under different climate-smart agriculture practices through a microbial lens. Candidates with demonstrated experiences in measuring soil biogeochemical and microbial properties related to soil organic matter stabilization and greenhouse gas emissions are preferred. Successful candidates will get opportunities to train and supervise undergraduate and graduate students. The initial appointment is for one year, renewal expected if progress is satisfactory and funds are available.

QUALIFICATIONS:\
 Suitable applicants for this position will hold a doctoral degree in soil science, biogeochemistry, agronomy, ecology, ecosystem science, geochemistry, biology, microbiology, or related disciplines. This position requires a highly motivated, organized, and creative individual with a demonstrated ability to carry out both independent and collaborative research. Effective time-management and good communication (written and oral) skills are essential attributes of a successful candidate for this position.
 
An ideal candidate will couple data collected in the lab and field with soil carbon cycle models. Candidates with experience in both measuring and modeling soil carbon cycle processes will get preference. Broader ideas and training on soil health and regenerative agriculture will be additional points for consideration. 
 
Interested candidates should apply via the online application form and submit a cover letter, curriculum vitae, and list of three references. For more information about the position, applicants may reach out to Dr. Debjani Sihi at debjani.sihi@emory.edu and direct any question they have about the position. Applications will be reviewed immediately and the position will remain open until a suitable candidate is found.
