 We had a great workshop for our ongoing project funded by the [DOE ESS program](https://www.debjanisihi.com/currentprojects/doe/).

 We have a ton of idea to explore now. Thanks to our awesome collaborators including [Jianqiu Zheng](https://www.pnnl.gov/people/jianqiu-zheng) (Pacific Northwest National Laboratory), [Eric Davidson](https://www.umces.edu/eric-davidson) (University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science), [Michael Weintraub](https://www.utoledo.edu/nsm/envsciences/faculty/weintraub.html) (University of Toledo), [Patrick Megonigal](https://serc.si.edu/staff/patrick-megonigal/megonigalp6122002) (Smithsonian Environmental Research Center), and [Lauren Kinsman-Costello](https://www.kent.edu/biology/profile/lauren-kinsman-costello) (Kent State University).
