We are happy to announce that we received funding from [the National Science Foundation(NSF)â€™s  Macrosystem Biology and NEON-Enabled Science program](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2106137&HistoricalAwards=false). We will upscale soil organic carbon measurements at the continental scale by understanding emergent ecosystem properties and spatial representativeness analysis.
