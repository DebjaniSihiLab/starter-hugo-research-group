Abstract:\
Cover: This issue, we feature two new studies from Agricultural & Environmental Letters. One describes a method that allows researchers to see redox status in wetland soils in real time (p. 3). The other pairs models with an affordable handheld tool to efficiently and accurately quantify soil iron (p. 8). The cover photo shows (top) the Nix Pro soil sensor, a palm-sized, diamond-shaped light-emitting spectrometer; and (bottom) Debjani Sihi (Emory University), Gaurav Jha (University of California, Davis), and Biswanath Dari (North Carolina A&T State University) using the tool in the field. Photos by Gaurav Jha (UC-Davis) and Aneesh Chandel.
