Congratulations to Dana for successfully defending her MS thesis, "Quantifying Gross Rates of Methane Production and Consumption in a Northern Forest". Dana's research was based on an NSF-funded project focused on the Northern Forests (https://www.debjanisihi.com/currentprojects/understanding-biophysical-drivers-of-the-ch4-source-sink-transition-in-northern-forests/). Dana graduated in Spring 2025 with an MS in Environmental Sciences from Emory.
