We are thrilled to receive funding from [the Department of Energy (DOE)’s Environmental System Science Program](https://ess.science.energy.gov/summary-of-environmental-system-science-projects-awarded-in-summer-2021/). We will use a ModEx (modeling-experimental) approach to predict greenhouse gas emissions from Terrestrial-Aquatic Interfaces (TAIs) using a modeling framework that couples redox reaction network model with a probability distribution function of soil microsites.
