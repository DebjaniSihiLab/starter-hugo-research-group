Jack Kagan has accepted an offer to participate in the prestigious SULI program at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) this summer. The SULI program, which stands for Science Undergraduate Laboratory Internships, is a highly competitive program that offers undergraduate students the opportunity to conduct research at national laboratories like PNNL.


PNNL is a highly regarded national laboratory located in Richland, Washington, and is known for its groundbreaking research in fields such as energy, environment, and national security. The researcher's work with Dr. Kenton Rod will be focused on projects related to the COMPASS program, which is aimed at developing new technologies for the analysis of complex data sets.

The SULI program is funded by the US Department of Energy's Office of Science and provides undergraduate students with the opportunity to participate in scientific research at one of 17 participating national laboratories. Participants receive a stipend for their work and are expected to conduct themselves in accordance with the program's guidelines and expectations.

This is a tremendous opportunity for the young researcher and represents a significant accomplishment in their academic and scientific career. We wish them the best of luck in their work with Dr. Rod and look forward to hearing more about their research this summer.
