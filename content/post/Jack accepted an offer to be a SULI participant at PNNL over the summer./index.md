Jack Kagan received an offer to participate in the prestigious [Science Undergraduate Laboratory Internships (SULI)](https://science.osti.gov/wdts/suli)program at [Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL)](https://www.pnnl.gov) this summer. The SULI program is a highly competitive program that offers undergraduate students the opportunity to conduct research at a DOE national laboratory. Jack will directly work with Dr. Kenton Rod and the [COMPASS](https://compass.pnnl.gov)(Coastal Observations, Mechanisms, and Predictions Across Systems and Scales) team. Congratulations, Jack!
