Marshall McCall, an alumnus of our lab group, was offered a position at the Morton Arboretum REU this summer outside of Chicago! He will be working on a project measuring root exudate production among different types of trees and linking exudation rates to soil carbon storage. In addition, he will get the chance to pursue a research project of his own related to soil ecology which he is very excited about. 
He thanks Debjani Sihi for introducing him to soil research! he said "I had a great experience in your lab last semester and would love to continue working with you in the fall if possible."
