Debjani Sihi (right) demonstrates using the Nix Pro to measure iron content in soil with colleagues Gaurav Jha (left) and Biswanath Dari. Iron is a vital micronutrient to grow plants and “a fundamental mineral species that dictates many other soil functions, like carbon storage, greenhouse gas emissions and nitrogen and phosphorous recycling,“ says Sihi, a biogeochemist in Emory’s Department of Environmental Sciences.
