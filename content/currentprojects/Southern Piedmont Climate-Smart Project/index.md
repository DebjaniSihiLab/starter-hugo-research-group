Brief description of the project: 

We are partnering with the Rodale Institute on a $25M project from the USDA's Partnerships for Climate Smart Commodities program. The project title is "Quantifying the Potential to Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Increase Carbon Sequestration by Growing and Marketing Climate-Smart Commodities in the Southern Piedmont‚Äù. Here is the project website: https://rodaleinstitute.org/science/southern-piedmont-climate-smart-project/

We are currently recruiting vegetable growers who are interested in adopting cover crops under both organic and conventional practices in the Southern Piedmont Area. 

Here is the call for applications: https://rodaleinstitute.org/blog/southern-piedmont-climate-smart-program-applications-open/
