Brief description of the project: 

We are organizing workshops, field days, outreach and community engagement activities on climate smart and regenerative agricultural practices in GA through this USDA project from the Beginning Farmer and Rancher Development Program. We are partnering with colleagues from North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University (Biswanath Dari, Osei Yeboah and team) to train beginning farmers and ranchers on climate-smart agriculture innovations, soil and water management practices, specialty crop production, agricultural entrepreneurship, digital technologies, and direct marketing strategies. 

Our first workshop will be organized at Oxford College Organic Farm on April 10, 2023. See the flyer and registration page (scan QR code).
