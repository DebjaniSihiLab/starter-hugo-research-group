Ellen Maas is a Postdoctoral Fellow in Environmental Sciences at Emory University. She is interested in the connection between agriculture and climate change and seeks both to reduce agriculture's contribution to greenhouse gases and increase its mitigation potential particularly through soil carbon sequestration. She uses predictive modeling with agroecosystem models and climate projections to address these questions.
