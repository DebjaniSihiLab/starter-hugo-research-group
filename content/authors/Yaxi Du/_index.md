Hi, I am Yaxi and a current master student in Laney Graduate School’s Environmental Science program. I got my Bachelor’s degree at the University of California, Davis with a major of Environmental Horticulture and Urban Forestry. I also minored in soil science during my undergraduate life. I am still exploring the specific topic about soil as my master thesis. Hope I can find one soon
