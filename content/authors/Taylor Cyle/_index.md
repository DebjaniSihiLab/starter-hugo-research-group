I’m an early career environmental scientist, aspiring to make meaningful contributions to the field of soil biogeochemistry and pass along my excitement to others. My research has been focused on the role of soil microbes in driving greenhouse gas emissions and sequestering carbon and nitrogen. I have experience ranging from ecosystem-scale work in grazing dairy systems in South Georgia to hunting for new microbes in mixed hardwood stands in upstate New York. My PhD work centered around using soil metabolomic approaches to understand the diversity of small compounds present in soil solution and how microbes transform them into mineral-associated organic matter.
