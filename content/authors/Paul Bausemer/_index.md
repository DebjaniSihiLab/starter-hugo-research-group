My name is Paul Bausemer, originally from Boston MA. What draws me to Environmental Science is the broad discipline of Sustainability Studies that I received throughout my Bachelors of Arts Degree at Colorado Mountain College, combined with years of hands-on technical experience in managing horticultural farms and ranches throughout the Western United States since 2012. Currently, I am a Laboratory Research Assistant in the Population Biology, Ecology and Evolution department at Emory University, under the supervision of Dr. Debjani Sihi. I am a certified Sustainability Excellence Associate with the ISSP through the World Green Building Council which can be described as a third-party verification and credential that demonstrates a competency of core sustainability concepts and best practices developed through global collaboration by sustainability practitioners.
