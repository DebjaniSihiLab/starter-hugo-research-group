Jacob is a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Plant and Microbial Biology working with Dr. Debjani Sihi. His current research uses process-based models to investigate mechanisms driving soil respiration responses to warming in arctic, temperate, and tropical settings. He is broadly interested in understanding soil carbon cycling and soil microbial activity from both a fundamental and applied perspective. Jacob holds a Ph.D. in Ecology and Evolution (2025) from the University of California, Santa Barbara, where he studied with Dr. Joshua Schimel.  His dissertation research ranged from developing a theoretical model to address the effects of molecular diversity on soil, to empirical studies that sought to understand how grazing management and organic amendments affect carbon storage. Jacob also holds a bachelor's degree in Ecology and Evolution from the University of California, Santa Barbara (2015) and spent several years working as a biologist for the National Park Service and for various non-profit conservation organizations.
