I am currently (Spring 2022) a 2nd year PhD student in Laney Graduate Schoolâ€™s program in Population Biology, Ecology, and Evolution. I graduated with a BS in Microbiology with Honors from the University of Kansas in Spring 2020. Although my undergraduate education is in infectious disease microbiology, my Honors thesis focused un characterizing microbial communities in stromatolites. I intend to do similar work in Terrestrial Aquatic Interfaces, using microbial community characterization to inform greenhouse gas emission predictions. -->
