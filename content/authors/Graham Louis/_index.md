I am a PhD student in the Soil Science program at North Carolina State University. I completed my BS in Computer Science at the University of Florida, during which, I contributed to the development of accessible learning materials for environmental systems modeling and to a large-scale harmonization of soil organic carbon data to optimize data accessibility and efficacy. My broader research interests lie at the intersection of ecological systems and computational modeling, with a focus on quantitative systems modeling, soil microbial dynamics, and biogeochemical processes. My current research goals are to integrate biogeochemistry and computational modeling to investigate soil microbial dynamics and their influence on carbon cycling, leading to the development of stakeholder-informed tools for sustainable land management and climate adaptation in agricultural systems.
