regulators. He later completed a second Master’s degree in Biotechnology at Fort Valley State
University (2024), working on the synthesis and characterization of zeolite-based nitrogen
nanofertilizers aimed at improving nitrogen use efficiency. Srinivas is currently a Research
Assistant in Dr. Debjani Sihi’s lab at NC State University. He will begin his Ph.D. in Soil Science
at NC State in August 2025. He represents one of the inaugural cohorts of the GRAD-AID for Ag training program at NC State (https://units.cals.ncsu.edu/grad-aid-for-ag-nrt/). His broader research interests include nutrient cycling, microbial
processes in soil systems, and sustainable land management.
