I am a biogeochemist who studies the effects of soil carbon cycling processes on the climate. During my Ph.D work, I used a series of incubation experiments to uncover processes influencing CO2 and CH4 production from peatlands. I also developed an empirically based methane flux model, which incorporated data derived from both incubation experiments and field measurements. Now, as a post-doctoral fellow at Emory, I use an experimental approach to probe the influence of soil heterogeneity on overall greenhouse gas fluxes. I aim to apply an understanding of this relationship to modeling efforts across wide geographic scales.
